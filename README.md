This repo contains the software associated with "Agglomerative Region Based Analysis" presented at ISBI 2020.

We do not reccomend using this software for clinical analysis.  The algorithm, as built here, biases in favor of larger regions of significance.  A forthcoming improvement is currently in press and both the algorithm and implementation are more robust than ARBA.  I'd be honored if this new work played some role in your research, please reach out to me at mhigger@ccs.neu.edu for an update.
